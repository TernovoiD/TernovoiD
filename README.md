Oh hi!

I am a Software Developer from Ukraine :) (Currently based in Varna, Bulgaria). My passion is iOS applications. I just love Swift programming language and all related things! Technologies I've already used in my projects include SwiftUI, Vapor, Firebase, CloudKIT, MapKIT, and WidgetKIT.

Before programming, I built a career as a Navigation Officer on a Tanker Fleet.
